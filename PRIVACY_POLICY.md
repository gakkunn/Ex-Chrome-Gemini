# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-12-07

This Privacy Policy applies to the Chrome extension "Gemini Shortcut Effective Extension" (the "Extension").

## 1. Information We Collect

The Extension does not transmit or store any personal information or usage data on servers controlled by the developer.

Some settings are stored locally in Chrome (e.g., feature toggles and custom keyboard shortcuts saved via `chrome.storage.sync`). This data stays on your devices synced by your Google account and is only used to run the Extension on `https://gemini.google.com/*`.

## 2. Sharing with Third Parties

The Extension does not provide data to third parties and does not collect information for tracking, analytics, or advertising purposes.

## 3. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
If we make important changes, we will announce them via the extension’s store page, release notes, or other appropriate means.

## 4. Contact
